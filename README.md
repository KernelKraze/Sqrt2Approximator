---

#### 🧮 Overview

This repository contains a program for calculating approximate values of square roots using continued fractions, achieving high precision.

#### 🚀 Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Compile the Program**:

   ```
   make
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:

   ```
   ./sqrt2
   ```

#### 📄 File Structure

- **main.c**: Contains the main function, which calculates and prints the square root approximation using continued fractions.
- **my_stdio.c**: Implements a simplified version of the `printf` function (`my_printf`) for formatting and printing output.
- **my_stdio.h**: Declares the `my_printf` function's header file.
- **sqrt2.c**: Contains the algorithm for calculating the square root approximation using continued fractions.
- **sqrt2.h**: Declares the `continuedFraction` function's header file.
